# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
       Mar's hemispheres online site is being reviewed as it is scraping-friendly and enhancement is to be made to include 
all four of the hemisphere images. We will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

# Results:
